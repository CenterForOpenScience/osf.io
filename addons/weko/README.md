## Setting up WEKO Add-on

An administrator of an institution can enable the WEKO add-on from the admin panel and set up the OAuth2 client information for WEKO. The members of the institution can link their WEKO account with their OSF account.

If the WEKO is non-HTTPS sites, you should set the `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` environment variable for osf.io:

```
OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1
```
