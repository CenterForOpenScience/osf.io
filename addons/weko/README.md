## Setting up WEKO Add-on

You should change `addons/weko/settings/local.py` as below:

```
REPOSITORIES = {'sample.repo.nii.ac.jp':
                 {'host': 'http://sample.repo.nii.ac.jp/weko/sword/',
                  'client_id': 'testclient2016a', 'client_secret': 'testpass2016a',
                  'authorize_url': 'http://sample.repo.nii.ac.jp/oauth/authorize.php',
                  'access_token_url': 'http://sample.repo.nii.ac.jp/oauth/token.php'}}
REPOSITORY_IDS = list(sorted(REPOSITORIES.keys()))
```

If `REPOSITORIES` includes non-HTTPS sites,
you should set the `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` environment variable for osf.io:

```
OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1
```
