    On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The difference between a project and a component
    is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of the project. There is also a [category
    field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option. The categorization essentially determines

    For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the entity is actually a file or folder, because
    it belongs to the `files` collection of the API.  They can be distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and
    folders use the same representation, but some attributes may be null for one kind but not the other. `size` will be
    null for folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be found [here](/v2/#storage-providers).

    * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created` refers to the time the file was
    first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file was last updated while in osfstorage.
    Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do it will correspond to the provider's
    semantics for created/modified times.  These timestamps may also be stale; metadata retrieved via the File Detail
    endpoint is cached.  The `last_touched` field describes the last time the metadata was retrieved from the external
    provider.  To force a metadata update, access the parent folder via its Node Files List endpoint.

    ##Relationships

    ###Registered from

    The registration is branched from this node.

    ###Registered by

    The registration was initiated by this user.

    ###Other Relationships

    See documentation on registered_from detail view.  A registration has many of the same properties as a node.

    ##Links

    See the [JSON-API spec regarding pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).

    The User Detail endpoint retrieves information about the user whose id is the final part of the path.  If `me`
    is given as the id, the record of the currently logged-in user will be returned.  The returned information includes
    the user's bibliographic information and the date the user registered.

    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, user information will not be serialized, and the id will be
    an empty string. Relationships to a user object will not show in this case, either.
