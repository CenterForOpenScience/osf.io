    """Details about files and folders. *Writeable*.

    Welcome to the Files API.  Brace yourself, things are about to get *weird*.

    The Files API is the one place in the GakuNin RDM API where we break hard from the JSON-API spec.  This is because most of
    the behind-the-scenes moving, uploading, deleting, etc. of files and folders is actually handled for us by a
    nifty piece of software called [WaterButler](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler).  WaterButler lets
    us interact with files stored on different cloud storage platforms through a consistent API.  However, it uses
    different conventions for requests, responses, and URL-building, so pay close attention to the documentation for
    [actions](#actions).  The exception is the "Get Info" action, which is OSF-centric.

    Only files and folders which have previously been retrieved through the Node Files List endpoint (accessible through
    the `files` relationship of their parent nodes) can be accessed through this endpoint.  Viewing a folder through the
    Node Files List vivifies their children's metadata in the GakuNin RDM and allows the children to be assigned ids.  This
    metadata is cached and can be refreshed by GETting the file via the Node Files List endpoint.

    Both files and folders are available through the Files API and are distinguished by the `kind` attribute ("file" for
    files, "folder" for folders).  Not all actions and relationships are relevant to both files and folders, so the
    applicable types are listed by each heading.

    ###Waterbutler Entities

    When an action is performed against a WaterButler endpoint, it will generally respond with a file entity, a folder
    entity, or no content.

    ####File Entity

        etag          string  etag - http caching identifier w/o wrapping quotes
        extra         object  varies depending on provider


    ##Attributes

    For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the entity is actually a file or folder, because
    it belongs to the `files` collection of the API.  They can be distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and
    folders use the same representation, but some attributes may be null for one kind but not the other. `size` will be
    null for folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be found [here](/v2/#storage-providers).

        name                        type               description
        ================================================================================================================

        path                        string             same as for corresponding WaterButler entity

                                                        for Google Drive, "box" for Box.com.

    * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created` refers to the time the file was
    first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file was last updated while in osfstorage.
    Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do it will correspond to the provider's
    semantics for created/modified times.  These timestamps may also be stale; metadata retrieved via the File Detail
    endpoint is cached.  The `last_touched` field describes the last time the metadata was retrieved from the external
    provider.  To force a metadata update, access the parent folder via its Node Files List endpoint.

    ##Relationships

    ###Node

    The `node` endpoint describes the project or registration that this file belongs to.

    ###Files (*folders*)

    The `files` endpoint lists all of the subfiles and folders of the current folder. Will be null for files.

    ###Versions (*files*)

    The `versions` endpoint provides version history for files.  Will be null for folders.

    ##Links

        info:        the canonical api endpoint for the folder's contents or file's most recent version
        new_folder:  url to target when creating new subfolders (null for files)
        move:        url to target for move, copy, and rename actions
        upload:      url to target for uploading new files and updating existing files
        download:    url to request a download of the latest version of the file (null for folders)
        delete:      url to target for deleting files and folders

    ##Actions

    The `links` property of the response provides endpoints for common file operations. The currently-supported actions
    are:

    ###Get Info (*files, folders*)

        Method:   GET
        URL:      /links/info
        Params:   <none>
        Success:  200 OK + file representation

    The contents of a folder or details of a particular file can be retrieved by performing a GET request against the
    `info` link. The response will be a standard OSF response format with the [OSF File attributes](#attributes).

    ###Download (*files*)

        Method:   GET
        URL:      /links/download
        Params:   <none>
        Success:  200 OK + file body

    To download a file, issue a GET request against the `download` link.  The response will have the Content-Disposition
    header set, which will will trigger a download in a browser.

    ###Create Subfolder (*folders*)

        Method:       PUT
        URL:          /links/new_folder
        Query Params: ?kind=folder&name={new_folder_name}
        Body:         <empty>
        Success:      201 Created + new folder representation

    You can create a subfolder of an existing folder by issuing a PUT request against the `new_folder` link.  The
    `?kind=folder` portion of the query parameter is already included in the `new_folder` link.  The name of the new
    subfolder should be provided in the `name` query parameter.  The response will contain a [WaterButler folder
    entity](#folder-entity).  If a folder with that name already exists in the parent directory, the server will return
    a 409 Conflict error response.

    ###Upload New File (*folders*)

        Method:       PUT
        URL:          /links/upload
        Query Params: ?kind=file&name={new_file_name}
        Body (Raw):   <file data (not form-encoded)>
        Success:      201 Created + new file representation

    To upload a file to a folder, issue a PUT request to the folder's `upload` link with the raw file data in the
    request body, and the `kind` and `name` query parameters set to `'file'` and the desired name of the file.  The
    response will contain a [WaterButler file entity](#file-entity) that describes the new file.  If a file with the
    same name already exists in the folder, the server will return a 409 Conflict error response.

    ###Update Existing File (*file*)

        Method:       PUT
        URL:          /links/upload
        Query Params: ?kind=file
        Body (Raw):   <file data (not form-encoded)>
        Success:      200 OK + updated file representation

    To update an existing file, issue a PUT request to the file's `upload` link with the raw file data in the request
    body and the `kind` query parameter set to `"file"`.  The update action will create a new version of the file.
    The response will contain a [WaterButler file entity](#file-entity) that describes the updated file.

    ###Rename (*files, folders*)

        Method:        POST
        URL:           /links/move
        Query Params:  <none>
        Body (JSON):   {
                        "action": "rename",
                        "rename": {new_file_name}
                       }
        Success:       200 OK + new entity representation

    To rename a file or folder, issue a POST request to the `move` link with the `action` body parameter set to
    `"rename"` and the `rename` body parameter set to the desired name.  The response will contain either a folder
    entity or file entity with the new name.

    ###Move & Copy (*files, folders*)

        Method:        POST
        URL:           /links/move
        Query Params:  <none>
        Body (JSON):   {
                        // mandatory
                        "action":   "move"|"copy",
                        "path":     {path_attribute_of_target_folder},
                        // optional
                        "rename":   {new_name},
                        "conflict": "replace"|"keep", // defaults to 'replace'
                        "resource": {node_id},        // defaults to current {node_id}
                        "provider": {provider}        // defaults to current {provider}
                       }
        Success:       200 OK or 201 Created + new entity representation

    Move and copy actions both use the same request structure, a POST to the `move` url, but with different values for
    the `action` body parameters.  The `path` parameter is also required and should be the GakuNin RDM `path` attribute of the
    folder being written to.  The `rename` and `conflict` parameters are optional.  If you wish to change the name of
    the file or folder at its destination, set the `rename` parameter to the new name.  The `conflict` param governs how
    name clashes are resolved.  Possible values are `replace` and `keep`.  `replace` is the default and will overwrite
    the file that already exists in the target folder.  `keep` will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new
    file's name until it no longer conflicts.  The suffix will be ' (**x**)' where **x** is a increasing integer
    starting from 1.  This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder.  The response will contain either a
    folder entity or file entity with the new name.

    Files and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers.  The `resource` parameter is the id of the node
    under which the file/folder should be moved.  It *must* agree with the `path` parameter, that is the `path` must
    identify a valid folder under the node identified by `resource`.  Likewise, the `provider` parameter may be used to
    move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the `resource` and `path` parameters must belong to a
    node and folder already extant on that provider.  Both `resource` and `provider` default to the current node and
    providers.

    If a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned.  Otherwise, a 201
    Created will be returned.

    ###Delete (*file, folders*)

        Method:        DELETE
        URL:           /links/delete
        Query Params:  <none>
        Success:       204 No Content

    To delete a file or folder send a DELETE request to the `delete` link.  Nothing will be returned in the response
    body.

    ##Query Params

    For this endpoint, *none*.  Actions may permit or require certain query parameters.  See the individual action
    documentation.
