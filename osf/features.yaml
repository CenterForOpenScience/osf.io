# This file contains the default configuration for our feature flipping using waffle flags and switches, this represents
# the intended configuration of flags at the time of release, if you plan to  switch the activity status of a feature in
# after release (during normal operation) please make sure that is reflected in this document by not explicitly setting
# it here. However features not intended to be after a release flipped should explicitly stated.

# Workflow:
# 1. Add a flag/switch with a name and value to this document
# 2. Run `manage_waffle` to create the flag(s)
# 3. Use the admin app to enable/disable the flag/switch at your convenience
# 4. When feature is complete add the activity status (active or everyone) to the value it will have in production until
# the old flipping code can be removed.
# 5. When a flag name is no longer referenced anywhere in this repo or in the Ember app remove it from this list.
