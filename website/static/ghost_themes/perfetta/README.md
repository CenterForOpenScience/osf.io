## Important information

This theme contains a few features which may require some additional knowledge or settings.

### Featured images/videos

The image or video placed at the beginning of the post will be used as a featured image/video on the post list. Additionally if you want to display the post over the title on the post page, you have to set the alternative text of the image to **featured-image**.

In theory you can use different images as a featured image on the posts’ list and on the post page (in this case you can add the **featured-image** alternative text to a different image).

The videos will be responsive thanks to the fitvids jQuery plugin.

### Animations

Animated blocks on the post list uses the [scrollReveal.js library](http://scrollrevealjs.org/). It is a very simple library for scroll-based animations. The official documentation for this library is [available here](https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js).

### Disqus comments

You can specify your Disqus username in the **partials/config.hbs** file in the following line:

```js
var disqus_shortname = '';
```

### Google Analytics support

You can specify your Google Analytics tracking code ID in the **partials/config.hbs** file in the following line:

```js
var ga_ua = 'UA-XXXXX-X';
```

### Background image

The image displayed in the background is a blog cover image which can be defined in the Ghost settings. 

If you want to use a responsive version of this image, you should leave blank the cover image under the Ghost settings and replace images in the **assets/images/** directory with your own ones.

### Logo area

The text "Free Ghost Theme" can be changed in the **partials/logo.hbs** file in the following fragment:

```html
 <small>Free Ghost Theme</small>
```

### Footer area

You can modify the content of the page footer in the **partials/footer.hbs** file. It will be displayed on all subpages of your Ghost blog.
