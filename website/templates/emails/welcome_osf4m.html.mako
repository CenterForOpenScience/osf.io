        Hello ${fullname},
        <br><br>
        Thanks for adding your presentation from ${conference} to the conference's <a href="${osf_url}">OSF Meetings</a> page! Sharing virtually is an easy way to increase the impact of your research.
        <br>
        %if downloads > 4:
        Your project files have been downloaded ${downloads} times!
        %endif
        <br>
        Have you considered adding your manuscript, data, or other research materials to the project? Adding these materials means:
        <ul>
            <li>When someone finds your poster or talk, they can see and cite the accompanying data</li>
            <li>You have one place to reference when looking for your research materials</li>
            <li>You can monitor interest in your data and materials by tracking downloads, just like you can for your ${conference} presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        To learn more about how the OSF can help you manage your research, read our <a href="https://help.osf.io/">Guides</a>.
        The best part? Itâ€™s all free! OSF is supported by the non-profit technology company, the <a href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a>.
        <br><br>
        Best wishes,
        <br>
