        Hello ${fullname},
        <br><br>
        We’ve noticed it’s been a while since you used the OSF. We are constantly adding and improving features, so we thought it might be time to check in with you.
        Most researchers begin using the OSF by creating a project to organize their files and notes. Projects are equipped with powerful features to help you manage your research:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>You can keep your work private, or make it public and share it with others</li>
            <li>You can use the wiki to live-edit content with your collaborators</li>
            <li>You can connect to third-party services like Dropbox or Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        To get started now, visit your dashboard and click on “Create a project.”

        <br>
        The OSF Team
