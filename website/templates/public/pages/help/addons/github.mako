        <p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a commonly used web based Git repository hosting service. After linking
                your OSF project to GitHub, you can add files to your GitHub repository and those files can be accessed via the OSF. Likewise, files added to the GitHub repository in your OSF account will update your GitHub account with that file. </p>
            <p> To link a GitHub repository to a project/component, visit your profile settings by clicking the gear in the top
                right of the page. Check "GitHub" under "Select Add-ons" to enable the add-on. Then, authenticate with GitHub by
                clicking the "Create Access Token" button and following the instructions on the
                GitHub page. Once you have created the access token in your user profile, you will not need to follow those first
                few steps again. </p>
            <p>After creating the access token for your user profile, visit the project you want to add a GitHub repository to.
                Click on the project name then go to "Settings" in the grey navigation bar. Select the GitHub add-on by clicking
                "OK" on the pop-up, then submitting. Authorize the GitHub repository by clicking the blue button. Once you have authorized GitHub then you need to either
                select a repository or create a new one.</p>
