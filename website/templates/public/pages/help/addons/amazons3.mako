        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service </a> (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams
                with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage."</p>
            <p>After linking your OSF project to Amazon s3, you can add files to your Amazon s3 bucket and those files can be
                accessed via the OSF. Likewise, files added to the Amazon s3 bucket in your OSF account will update your Amazon s3
                account with that file.</p>
            <p>To link Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket to a project/component, visit your profile settings by clicking the
                gear in the top right of the page. Check "Amazon Simple Storage Service" under "Select Add-on." Next, authenticate
                Amazon Simple Storage Service by entering the access key and secret key. Then, click "Submit."</p>
            <p>Once you have enabled Amazon Simple Storage Service in your user settings, you won't need to do those previous steps
                again. To associate a bucket with a project, visit the project you want to add a Amazon Simple Storage Service
                bucket to. Go to "Settings" in the grey navigation bar. Select the Amazon Simple Storage Service add-on under
                "Select Add-ons" and click"OK" on the pop-up. Then, submit your new settings.</p>
            <p>Once you have authorized Amazon Simple Storage you need to either create or select a bucket from the dropdown.</p>
