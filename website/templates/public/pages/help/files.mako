        <p>Each project and component can have its own set of files. This allows you to organize your files into meaningful
                groups like datasets or background research.</p>
            <p>Each file is also given a unique, persistent URL, meaning that it can be cited or linked to individually.</p>
            <p id="version-control">To upload a file, click on "Files" in the grey navigation bar under the Project/Component's title.
                Drag the file from your desktop onto the screen to upload, or select a storage add-on in the files pane and click the upload
                button in the toolbar.</p>
            <p>Click on a file's name to view it. From this page, you can also:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the &ldquo;Share&rdquo; button to link to your file or embed it on your blog or website.</li>
              <li>
                &ldquo;Check out&rdquo; the file to prevent collaborators from making changes to the file while you're working on it
                (must have &ldquo;Write&rdquo; or &ldquo;Admin&rdquo; privileges).
              </li>
                <li>Tag your file to enhance discoverability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OSF Storage, the default storage add-on for every project, supports version control.
                You can create new versions of a file by re-uploading the latest copy&mdash;no need to change the name.
                To view or download old versions, first click on the file's name. Then click on the &ldquo;Revisions&rdquo; button on the top right
                of the page when viewing the file (the File Detail page).</p>
              <p>To download a file, select the file and click the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button that appears in the toolbar. To delete a file,
                select the file and click the Delete button. You can create folders by selecting the appropriate
                storage add-on and clicking the &ldquo;Create Folder&rdquo; button in the toolbar.</p>
            <p>Only contributors of that component with writing privileges can add or delete a file. If a component is set to
                be private, then no one will be able to see the enclosed files, but public components and projects allow
                anyone to download their materials.</p>
