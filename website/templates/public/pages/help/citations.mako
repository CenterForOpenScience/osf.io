        <p>Every project, component, file, and user has a unique URL on the OSF. This means that anything you upload
        and make public on the OSF can be cited, giving you credit for your work.</p>
        <p>To find a pre-formatted citation for a project, look directly below the grey navigation bar on the project's
        page and you will see the URL to be cited. If you click "more" then you will see the APA, MLA, and Chicago
        citations.</p>

    <p>The OSF offers DOIs and ARKs in addition to its own unique and persistent URLs. DOIs and ARKs can only be issued
    to public <a href="#registrations">registrations</a>. To be issued one of these identifiers, visit your public registration
    and click "Create DOI/ARK" below the project title.</p>
