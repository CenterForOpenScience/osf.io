Please see https://psyarxiv.com/hvfmr/ for complete details.\n\nReligiosity (IV): Religiosity is measured using a newly created scale with a subset of items from the Religion and Spirituality module of the 2004 mail survey. The scale includes general questions about how religious/spiritual the individual is and how important religion/spirituality is to them. The specific variables are as follows:\n\nil001rer: How religious are you?\nil002rer: How spiritual are you?\nil003rer: How important is religion in your life?\nil004rer: How important is spirituality in your life?\nil005rer: How important was it, or would it have been if you had children, to send your children for religious or spiritual instruction?\nil006rer: How closely do you identify with being a member of a religious group?\n\nThe levels of all of these variables are indicated by a Likert scale with the following options: (1) Not at all; (2) Not very; (3) Somewhat; (4) Very; (5) Extremely, as well as ‘System Missing’ (the participant did not provide an answer) and ‘Refused’ (the participant refused to answer the question). Variable il006rer additionally includes the option ‘Don’t know’ (the participant stated that they did not know how to answer the question). We will use the average score (after omitting non-numeric and ‘Don’t know’ responses) on the variables as a measure of religiosity. \n\nProsociality (DV): We will use three measures of prosociality that measure three aspects of engagement in other oriented activities. The prosociality variables come from the Volunteering module of the 2004 phone survey. \n\ngv103re: Did the graduate do volunteer work in the last 12 months? \n\nThis dichotomous variable assesses whether or not the participant has engaged in any volunteering activities in the last 12 months.
